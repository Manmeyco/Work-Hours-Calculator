# Work-Hours-Calculator
It is very simplistic, but it does what it needs to do.
You input your start and end times for each day of the week (Mon-Fri), and it outputs a dollar amount.

I made this because I couldn't find anything that could do this for me, and I was sick and tired of using a calculator and double-guessing myself.
I'm sure there are many ways to do this much better, but I needed it done simply and effectively.

It accounts for overtime by calculating time and a half for time worked more than 8 hours.
